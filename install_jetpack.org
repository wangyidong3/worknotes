At last, I changed the host to nuc as a real pc host!!!!!

Do not try vm, please!! life is too short for this!
Use the installed Nuc and bring them home, use your own network. Just one hour and all things can be done automatically.

The best solution is to install the jetpack on a real laptop!

1. I currently use ubuntu14.04(not necessary to try new one, make it easy!!!) on a virtualbox as host for installing jetpack on jetson tx2
2. so, 
   a. install ubuntu14 as least 50G(jetpack need a lot of space!!!) , if your virtualbox space is not enough, check here:

   b. download: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/jetpack-l4t-3_1
3. run the script and follow the instruction of the link above(Very important tutorial)
4. as for vm, it's common that vm doesn't display the usb device from the host pc. Check here: 
   a. install extension pack, https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
   b. add user to the new group: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20021300/usb-devices-are-not-recognized-in-virtualbox-linux-host
   c. add a new usb filter for Nvidia's micro-usb VirtualBox->Device->USB->filter
   d. choose usb 2.0 (ECHI): shutdown the vm and Device->USB->xxxx
5. Sometimes, you may need to uninstall a little (such as delete by mistake): https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1000253/jetpack-not-able-to-load-on-tx1/
