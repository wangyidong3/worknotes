very good way to debug cmakelist:

MESSAGE(WARNING "install path ${OpenCV_INSTALL_PATH}")
MESSAGE(WARNING "config path ${OpenCV_CONFIG_PATH}") # if this is in cache, find_package() below won't overwrite it

find_package(OpenCV 2.4 REQUIRED) # change this to 3 after running cmake once
MESSAGE(WARNING "version ${OpenCV_VERSION}")
MESSAGE(WARNING "install path ${OpenCV_INSTALL_PATH}") 
MESSAGE(WARNING "config path ${OpenCV_CONFIG_PATH}") # look at the output of this message
MESSAGE(WARNING "include dirs ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
MESSAGE(WARNING "libs ${OpenCV_LIBS}")
